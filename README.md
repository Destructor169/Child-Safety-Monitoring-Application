# Child-Safety-Monitoring-Application

Designed and deployed an Android/iOS app for a smart bicycle to help parents monitor their childâ€™s safety. This was done as a Course Project alongside my fellow student Aditya Kumar. The Course was ES244: Signal, Systems and Random Processes, under the guidance of Professor Nithin V. George, IIT Gandhinagar.

The smart bicycle has embedded hardware sensors and systems such as a gyroscope, accelerometer, GPS, microphone, and antenna. For this problem statement, assume that your Android/iOS mobile phone (Phone A) behaves as the smart IoT embedded system and you are riding a (sensorless old-fashioned) bicycle. It is able to transmit the data to your partner's device (parentsâ€™ Android/iOS mobile hereafter referred to as Phone ðŸ˜Ž for warning.

#The child-monitoring Android/iOS app (during cycling) is able to do the following:

Continuously monitor the GPS, accelerometer, and gyroscope data of your phone to determine the following
Over speed
Fall detection
Boundary crossing (defined some geographical coordinates)
If the cycle goes beyond a particular perimeter, or over speeds, your device should do the following: Play a beep alarm sound on your device (Phone A). Display the real-time location of phone A on phone B using Google Maps and play a beep sound on Phone B.
If the cycle falls, your device should do the following: Play a beep alarm sound on your device (Phone A), with an option to switch OFF the alarm. Display the real-time location of phone A on phone B using Google Maps and play a beep sound on Phone B. If the alarm is not switched OFF within 5 seconds by Phone A, a) Switch on the microphone and camera of phone A automatically and start recording. b) Send an SOS from phone A to phone B by transmitting the recorded sound and images using mobile internet network.
This has been done using the MATLAB Simulink support package for android/ios applications.
